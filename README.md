# Ayomide Fase - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About Me

Hi! I am Ayomide Fase and I'm a data analyst passionate about uncovering the stories hidden within data. My background in Animal Science, where I honed my analytical skills by studying livestock genetics and revenue prediction, provided a strong foundation for my transition into data analysis in 2022. Analyzing experimental data for my thesis further ignited my interest in the power of data-driven insights.

Since then, I've focused on building a robust data analysis skillset. I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, gaining expertise in data cleaning, manipulation, transformation, analysis, and visualization. I'm also proficient in SQL and R, and have experience with creating interactive dashboards using Tableau. An internship provided valuable hands-on experience, collaborating with senior analysts on competitor analysis and product development research. I enjoy tackling real-world data challenges, as demonstrated in my Netflix Performance Insights project, where I used API integration to collect and analyze data.

My curiosity extends beyond the workplace; I regularly explore datasets in my free time, driven by a desire to uncover insights and understand how data can drive positive change. This continuous learning mindset is reflected in my portfolio, where each project showcases my ability to translate complex data into actionable narratives.

## Portfolio Projects
### [Reducing Churn: A Comparative Analysis of Streaming and Non-Streaming Subscribers](https://github.com/Ayofase/Telco-Churn-Analysis/tree/main)

**Goals:** Analyze customer churn drivers, particularly for streaming subscribers, to develop data-driven recommendations and an interactive dashboard for improved retention and maximized customer lifetime value.

**Description:** This project analyzes customer churn for a telecom company, focusing on the impact of streaming services. Key findings revealed higher churn among fiber optic customers despite it being ideal for streaming, suggesting pricing or service quality issues. Furthermore, while longer-term contracts effectively reduced churn, streaming service usage presented a complex relationship with churn. Recommendations include enhancing the fiber optic customer experience, targeted retention campaigns for streamers, and optimized onboarding processes. An interactive Tableau dashboard facilitates exploration of these findings.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data analysis, Data Visualisation and Interactive dashboard.

**Tools:** Excel, SQL, R and Tableau
