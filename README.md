# Ayomide Fase - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About Me

Hi! I am Ayomide Fase and a data analyst passionate about uncovering the stories hidden within data. My background in Animal Science, where I honed my analytical skills by analysing data to derive insights on livestock genetics and revenue prediction, provided a strong foundation for my transition into data analysis in 2022. Analyzing experimental data for my thesis further fueled my interest in the power of data-driven insights.

Since then, I've focused on building a robust data analysis skillset. I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, gaining expertise in data cleaning, manipulation, transformation, analysis, and visualization. I further upskilled by completing the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, gaining expertise in feature engineering, model development, hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation. I'm also proficient in SQL and R, Python and have experience with creating interactive dashboards using Tableau. An internship provided valuable hands-on experience, collaborating with senior analysts on competitor analysis and product development research. I enjoy tackling real-world data challenges, as demonstrated in my Netflix Performance Insights project, where I used API integration to handle missing data.

I regularly explore datasets in my free time, driven by a desire to uncover insights and understand how data can drive business growth. This continuous learning mindset is reflected in my portfolio, where each project showcases my ability to translate complex data into actionable narratives.

## Portfolio Projects
### [Reducing Churn & Optimizing Customer Success: From Analysis to Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/Ayofase/Telco-Churn-Analysis/tree/main)

**Goals:** Analyze customer behavior and service usage patterns to understand the key customer churn drivers, particularly for streaming subscribers, and to predict customer likely to churn developing data-driven recommendations and an interactive dashboard for improved retention and maximized customer lifetime value.

**Description:** This project predict and analyzes customer churn for a telecom company, focusing on the impact of streaming services. Key findings revealed higher churn among fiber optic customers despite it being ideal for streaming, suggesting pricing or service quality issues. Furthermore, while longer-term contracts effectively reduced churn, streaming service usage presented a complex relationship with churn. Recommendations include enhancing the fiber optic customer experience, targeted retention campaigns for streamers, and optimized onboarding processes. An interactive Tableau dashboard facilitates exploration of these findings.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data analysis, Data Visualisation and Interactive dashboard, Feature Engineering, Model Development, Model Evaluation.

**Tools:** Excel, SQL, R and Tableau, Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn ) 

### [Netflix Streaming Performance (2019-2024): A Data-Driven Analysis of Revenue, Membership, and Content Engagement Trends](https://github.com/Ayofase/Netflix-performance-insights/tree/main)

**Goals:** Analyze key revenue drivers and content performance metrics to inform Netflix's content strategy and develop an interactive dashboard to empower data-driven decision-making regarding revenue, user growth, and content investments.

**Description:** This project analyzes Netflix's streaming performance from 2019-2024, using revenue and content engagement data to inform content strategy. Key findings include substantial global revenue and membership growth, varying regional performance trends (especially ARPU decline in EMEA), and the positive impact of increased content releases on viewership. An interactive Tableau dashboard enables dynamic exploration of these trends to facilitate data-driven decisions. Despite limitations in data granularity and missing values, the analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing content investments and maximizing growth.

**Skills:** API Integation, Data cleaning, Data analysis, Data Visualisation and Interactive dashboard.
**Tools:** Excel, SQL, R and Tableau
